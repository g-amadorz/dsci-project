    "### **Broad Question:**  \n",
    "What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Specific Question:**  \n",
    "Can a player’s **experience level** and **total played hours** predict whether they will subscribe to the **newsletter** in the `players.csv` dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Response and Explanatory Variables:**  \n",
    "- **Response Variable (Outcome):** `subscribe` (Boolean: True/False) – Whether a player subscribes to the newsletter.\n",
    "- **Explanatory Variables (Predictors):**\n",
    "  - `experience` (Categorical: Pro, Veteran, Amateur, Regular) – The skill level or familiarity of the player.\n",
    "  - `played_hours` (Numeric) – The total number of hours a player has spent in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Preparation & Wrangling:**  \n",
    "To ensure the data is in a usable form for predictive modeling, the following preprocessing steps will be applied:\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning:**\n",
    "   - Remove unnecessary columns such as the (`hashedEmail`, `name`) as they do not contribute to prediction.\n",
    "   - Handle missing values, specifically filling in missing (`Age`, `played_hours`)  values with the median or mean.\n",
    "   - Standardize categorical variables (`experience`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection:**\n",
    "   - Keep only relevant columns (`subscribe`, `experience`, `played_hours`).\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Transformations & Encoding:**\n",
    "   - Convert `experience` into a factor variable to use it as a categorical predictor.\n",
    "   - Ensure `subscribe` is treated as a binary outcome variable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Exploratory Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Compute mean played hours for each experience level and visualize trends.\n",
    "   - Examine the proportion of subscribers within each experience group.\n",
    "   - Use visualizations (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots) to check for patterns between playtime, experience, and subscription likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How the Data Will Address the Question:**  \n",
    "By analyzing trends in `experience` and `played_hours`, we can determine whether certain player types are more likely to subscribe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Perform descriptive statistics and visualizations to confirm assumptions and.\n",
    "- Identify any necessary data transformations before predictive modeling.\n",
    "- Choose and implement an appropriate classification model for prediction.\n"
